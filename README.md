# Random Wikipedia From Category

Click a button in your browser to get a random page in a Wikipedia category--including pages in deeply nested subcategories.

The (Mediawiki-supported way of doing this)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Random_page_in_category] does not look into subcategories. For example, using that on (this category page for Math)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics] would only yield you the ~40 direct top-level links on that page, but you know there are more than 40 articles about math on Wikipedia.

This extension caches links to all the pages in your selected category for a week so that you do not have to abuse Wikipedia's servers.

## Usage

1. Install from Chrome Web Store
2. Right click the extension button in the toolbar and click `Options`
3. Enter the name of the category page. For example: "Category:Mathematics" or "Category:Computer_science"
